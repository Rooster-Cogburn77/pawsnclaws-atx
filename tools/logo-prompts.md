## What to Avoid

- Overly detailed illustrations (won't scale)
- Realistic cat photos or drawings
- Too many colors
- Thin lines that disappear at small sizes
- Trendy effects (3D, chrome, excessive gradients)
- Generic clip-art cat images
- Text that's unreadable when small

## Generator-Specific Tips

### For Midjourney:
Add `--style raw --stylize 50` for cleaner results
Add `--ar 1:1` for square format

### For DALL-E:
Be explicit about "vector style" and "flat design"
Request "professional logo design" context

### For Ideogram:
Good for text integration - use for wordmark versions
Specify "typography logo" for better text rendering

### For Adobe Firefly:
Use "graphic design" and "logo" style settings
Can generate vector-ready output
